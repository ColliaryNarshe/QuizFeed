## QuizFeed
<br>
A study program that feeds the user questions and answers.

### Setup
<br>

Add a quiz text file to /quizes directory. Quiz files use a specific code to differentiate between questions and answers. <br><br>To make one, try one of the three following methods:

1. The Quiz Editor from the File menu.

2. Create a quiz file manually by making a .txt file and adding "Q: " and "A: " codes (note the spaces) at the start of lines. Open demo.txt in a text editor to see an example.

3. Convert a regular text file in /quizes, using the "Convert to QF Format" in the Tools menu. This will take the first line of the text and mark it as a question, then the second line as an answer, and so on until the end of the file. Blank lines are ignored. (Note: You can find the option to view and select normal text files in the File menu.) The downside to this method is each Q&A are only one line each.

* If you wish to use other directories besides /quizes for your quiz files, you can add new paths from the File menu.

### Usage
<br>
To run a quiz, select a file from the list and press Enter, or double-click with the mouse. Press F on your keyboard to change the font size, and open the 'Quiz' dropdown menu to see other options.
